5. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git starts tracking the files, and creates associated files for doing so.  Without the repository initialization, you wouldn't have version control.

8. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area holds the changes you wish to commit.  It sets you up for a snapshot creation.  It allows you to separate the changes you have, at least by file, so that a logical commit can be made.
