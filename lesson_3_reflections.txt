7. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Using a remote repository allows for collaboration, or for easily using multiple places to work on your code.

10. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Compatibility may be an issue, but I'm assuming it's not what is expected here, the biggest issue I can think of might be that you may want to go a different direction with the code altogether.  Staying up-to-date with your remote repository may hinder your progress or take what your doing in a direction you didn't want to go.
